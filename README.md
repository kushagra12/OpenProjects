### The Problem

In most technical organizations (barring several tech-startups), the people proposing ideas are not necessarily the people implementing ideas; that is, there exists an obvious-yet-detrimental gap between people who ideate (or the high level management) & developers. **OpenProjects** fits in to bridge this gap, by letting developers give their preference and/or opinions on a set of ideas proposed by fellow team members.

### Why Preferences?

It is common for developers working (in teams) on projects to lose interest over time. Something which intrigues them today may not intrigue them tomorrow. They are more likely to lose interest in an idea if they weren't entirely fond of it to begin with but were forced into developing it due to time constraints, lack of workforce, lack of better ideas or other similar reasons.
Using preferences, the Admin(s) can understand how a developer feels about a particular idea & also the quality of output they could expect. This helps the Admin(s) make an informed decision about the best developer candidates to work on a particular idea. The following _four_ preferences are available for every idea:
1. Extremely Interested - I will see this through to completion
2. I like the idea - won't be willing to implement though
3. I don't like the idea - but I will be interested in the tech involved
4. Not Interested - This isn't my cup of tea
